# Key Packages

1) langchain - Seems to be a custom or specialized library, given the multiple modules imported from it (like vectorstores, embeddings, llms, and chains).
2) chainlit - Chainlit is an open-source asynchronous Python framework that enables developers to build scalable Conversational AI or agentic applications quickly and efficiently.

# Setup

### Clone the repository

### Install required dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Start the ChatBot

python -m chainlit run model.py

# Requirements

To run this project, you will need the following packages:

Make sure to install these packages using `pip` before running the project.

# Workflow

This section outlines the workflow of our therapy chatbot, designed to provide support and prevent suicidal attempts. The workflow is divided into several key stages:

### User Interaction
- Users begin by interacting with the chatbot through a conversational interface.
- The chatbot utilizes natural language processing to understand and respond to user inputs.

### Alert Mechanism

- Upon detecting potential suicidal intent, the chatbot triggers an automated alert system.
- An email notification is sent to a designated organization for immediate human intervention.

### Follow-Up

- The organization can then reach out to the user to provide further assistance and resources.
- The chatbot also provides information on how to access professional help and emergency services.

### Continuous Improvement

- User interactions are analyzed to improve the chatbot's responses and detection capabilities.
- Feedback loops are established to refine the system and enhance its effectiveness.

# Role of Vector Database

A **Vector Database** is a specialized database designed to store, manage, and index high-dimensional vector data efficiently. These vectors, also known as embeddings, are numerical representations of data objects that carry semantic information.

In our therapy chatbot, the vector database plays a crucial role in understanding and processing user inputs. By converting text into vector embeddings, the chatbot can analyze the conversation's context, detect crisis situations, and provide relevant and personalized support to the user.

The use of a vector database ensures that our chatbot responds with high accuracy and relevance, making it a vital component in our mission to offer timely assistance and prevent suicidal attempts.

This workflow ensures that users receive timely and appropriate support, while also facilitating human intervention when necessary.
